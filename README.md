## Welcome to GitHub Pages
## Portfolio

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aashimaahuja/aashimaahuja.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
I am a frontend engineer with an experience of over 5 years. I have hands on experienceworking with web frameworks and technologies. I have extensively worked on react and typescript for 3 years.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
